        <p>my main personal page! i want to develop this, but i'm not entirely sure what i want. i don't know what i could say about myself and it might just be a list of links. i really like having a guestbook though it's fuuunn :D</p>

        <p>this was honestly just a test for messing around with media in html/css and containing it. very interesting and fun. i wish i could retain how to do this</p>

        <p>i made this for a school assignment where we had to make 5 pages. not very descriptive and i think i took it a little far but i mean i think it's cool! i got to do things i've never done before (buttons/forms) so that was cool</p>
